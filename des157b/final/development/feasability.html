                <h3>Features</h3>
                • Users can type in their name in the beginning. <br/>
                • Users can type in answers to questions relating to their own thoughts, experiences, etc. like “What advice would you give to yourself 5 years ago?” or “What would you say to a student who is going through a lot of pressure?” .. questions like these <br/>
                • A nice suggestion I got was a grid of these thoughts if users just want to see the answers to these questions <br/>
                • Users can view what other people answered to these questions as they go through the interactive story <br/>

                <h3>Technologies</h3>
                • Back4App to store user data (?) → if not enough time, this will be shortened to a Google Form instead <br/>
                • Animation library (like Anime.js) <br/>
                • Digital Art software (Adobe Illustrator?) <br/>
                • Something for a one page effect with smooth scrolling (can probably be done in regular HTML/CSS/JS) <br/>

                <h3>Assessment</h3>
                • I am knowledgeable at Back4App as we have done it as a class example this quarter. I’m also comfortable with using JavaScript libraries such as Anime.js. <br/>
                • I don’t have experience with Digital Art/Adobe Illustrator but I took suggestions from my classmates to draw the art on paper beforehand, then upload it to Adobe Illustrator to refine the sketch. I think I can reasonably get skilled at this portion of the project within the timeframe, and if not, a backup plan would be to just use pictures (although I highly prefer art).
