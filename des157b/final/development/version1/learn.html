            <span>
                The stigma of reaching out for help due to mental illness has been prevalent in asian-american families for many years. 
                This issue roots from the conflict of cultuiral beliefs & values amongst these families of different cultures with the idea of reaching out for help.
                
            <br/> <br/>
            Many families suffer insecurity or fear of weakness, while others feel the need to surpress their emotions to refrain from seeing weak. 
            some kids feel the pressure of taking care of their immigrant family as a first-generation student. Some adults feel afraid of the shame of not meeting societal standards.
            <br/><br/>
            I am an asian-american myself who has experienced first-hand some of the many issues of why individuals, specfically asian-american indiividuals, have restraint from seeking for mental help.
            <br/><br/>
            I'm here to express in a simplistic, dorky, digital format that you are never alone in the fight of mental illness.
