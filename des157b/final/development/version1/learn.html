            <p>
                <span class="orange">The stigma of reaching out for mental health</span> has been prevalent in asian-american families for many years. 
                This issue roots from the conflict of cultuiral beliefs & values amongst these families of different cultures with the idea of reaching out for help.
            
                
            <br/> <br/>
            Many families suffer insecurity or fear of weakness, while others feel the need to <span class="blue">suppress their emotions</span> to refrain from seeing weak. 
            Some kids feel the pressure of taking care of their immigrant family as a first-generation student. Some adults feel afraid of the shame of not meeting societal standards.
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="yellow">I am an asian-american</span> myself who has experienced first-hand some of the many issues of why individuals, specfically asian-american indiividuals, have restraint from seeking for mental help.
            <br/><br/>
            I'm here to express in a simplistic, dorky, digital format that <span class="green">you are never alone in the fight of mental illness.</span>
