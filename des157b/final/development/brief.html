                <h3>project summary</h3>
                <p>My project focuses on the mental health struggle that asian-americans (specifically youth) face by creating an interactive desktop website hoping to encourage any user that uses my site to seek for help when dealing wth mental illness.</p>

                <h3>project goals</h3>
                <p>My goals for my project is to tell a story in the shoes of an Asian-American youth dealing with mental struggles that resonates with my users, and allows them to express their own thoughts, feelings, and encouraging words in a meaningful way. Perhaps the main character of my story experiences the many different issues found in Asian-American culture, such as refusing to receive help, the pressure to succeed, the pressure placed by their parents, the "model minority" myth, etc. I hope to create good UX and experiment with making my own art to aid with the story telling. Most importantly, my goal is that in the end, my users feel better and/or encouraged.</p>

                <h3>design strategies</h3>
                <p>I think I really like the idea of a one-page website, however, if users are inputting their own data, I might have to reconsider. What I aim to have is a simple UI where the color scheme is black and white with occassionally blue to emphasize some elements/moods expressed on the page. I want to include digital art if possible, and include a handwriting-esque font for the typography.</p>

                <h3>interaction strategies</h3>
                <p>As for interactions, I want to incorporate something similar to our mad libs project but instead of wacky questions, users are answering questions related to their own experiences and are giving encouraging words to do the same. Although, I want to make this form optional. I want users to be able to scroll or click through the site to read through a story that I'm going to present. </p>

                <h3>experience goals</h3>
                <p>I want my users to be able to see parts of themselves when going through my website. I want them to be able to relate regardless of who they are. In the end, I hope that my website has touched them deeply, made them think, and has encouraged them to share the site to someone they care about.</p>
