                <h3>Summary</h3>
                In my sharing sessions with two different individuals, I expressed that I was a little shaky on my topic, but
                I received a lot of good feedback about how important it is to touch base on the mental health stigma within Asian-American culture.
                I'm still uncertain about how I'd want to lead users to check out my project, but I definitely am interested in the idea of using QR Codes since it's also something I've worked with before. My ideas are still rough
                so currently I don't know what changes I'd make, but I'm now very certain about my topic and that I want to create a responsive web & mobile app.
