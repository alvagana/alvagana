                <h3>#1: "Mental Health Among Asian Americans" - Article by Koko Nishi, MA (2012)</h3>
                <h4>https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/asian-american/article-mental-health</h4>
                <p>In a short article written by Koko Nishi, she researched about how mental illness plays a role in Asian American culture.
                    Overall, she found that Asian-Americans are far less likely to seek for mental health services, especially young adults, due to a multitude of issues ranging from parental pressure, various stereotypes placed by the American society, to racial & cultural discrimination. This article was helpful for my research because I learned more about why Asian-Americans choose not to receive help, such as having a language barrier. Thus, I’m looking at how I can address this language barrier issue on my project, if I choose to do so.</p>

                <h3>#2: "Mental Illness in Stressful Times - An Asian-American Family's Story" - Interview with Dr. Richard Nakamura by the National Institute of Mental Health (2016)</h3>
                <h4>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usI6PDwMjcw</h4>
                <p>In this small interview with Dr. Richard Nakamura, he told an anecdote about his family moving to California during WWII about how his grandfather fought mental illness, and in fear of affecting the family, he committed suicide. The world war and concentration camps of Japanese Americans acted a source of the stressors of many Asian-Americans at the time, that led to generations of continued mental illness among the family. I learned that the stigma of mental health roots deeper into the history of Asian-Americans in the U.S., especially during the WWII, the Exclusion Act, etc. Figuring out about how the elder population has dealt with these issues is now something I’d like to research on and I hope to do so by reading more of these stories.</p>

                <h3>#3: "Why Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders Don’t go to Therapy" - Blog Post by Ryann Tanap (2019)</h3>
                <h4>https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/July-2019/Why-Asian-Americans-and-Pacific-Islanders-Don-t-go-to-Therapy</h4>
                <p>In this blog post by Ryann Tanap, she speaks on her experience as a Filipina-American joining a therapy session to receive mental illness help, only to find herself disappointed. She speaks on the various issues on why many people of color, especially Asian-Americans, are less than likely to receive mental health care, and stresses that a structural change of education is required in schools to make it mandatory for schools to teach about mental illness to ultimately remove the stigma. This is helpful to me because I know that this issue should be bigger and more well-known to the public, and that looking into the future, schools are a key factor to help the upbringing of the Asian-American youth.</p>
