                <h3>observations</h3>
                <p>My focus for usability testing was to see a user's experience in creating notes and going through the story. <br/>
                    <br/> Some notable observations I had were:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - Typography choice is very personable and it matches well with the aesthetics of my drawings. However, the text shadow could be omitted as it will help with the readability.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - Making a note is very smooth and easy to do, although leading to a new page to acknowledge a successfully created note would add to the overall user experience.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - Small improvements could be made, from making text bigger such as the character count label and the message label in the "create a note" page, but overall the project is coming along
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>plan to update final project</h3>
                <p>All the suggestions I had were super helpful. I feel that user testing is the most helpful assignment in getting feedback and really understanding the experience of using your website. A plan that I have is to continue making my drawings,
                    but changing the interaction of the story by having multiple options to navigate through. I'm planning to add another page to hold the "thank you" when creating a note, and to consider changing the typography styling to make it more
                    readable for users.
                </p>
