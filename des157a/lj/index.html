                I am an avid online shopper. On some of my off days, you can find me browsing clothing stores and shopping sites for fun, such as Amazon, Uniqlo, Etsy—you name it. Sometimes, when I encounter an online form or shopping site feature that I dislike, I’ll think of different ways of how I would fix it. This sometimes is part of my creative process of design ing forms or input fields on websites.
            <br/><br/>
                One of the biggest takeaways from reading the article is that it’s imperative to be clear and straightforward if you want users to have a good experience with not only forms, but with most features. Being too complex by asking hard questions off the bat, not specifying how to answer questions, and not being transparent with the user about how the information is being used are all red flags. 
            <br/><br/>
                Another takeaway is that developers and designers need to think about the broad range of users that will use their form — hence, we need to think accessibility. I think part of having a good experience is having an accessible website with features such as text enlarging or being able to use screen readers. A good example is <a href="https://kravebeauty.com" target="_blank">Krave Beauty</a> because they have a cool accessibility button to use different kinds of features when browsing/ordering.
