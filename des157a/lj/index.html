                        Modals are a really effective UI feature that can be used to get the user’s attention. When used correctly, it adds a nice flow to the site’s purpose. But incorrect use, due to incorrectly developing/incorporating a modal, can hurt more than benefit.
                    <br/><br/>
                        For example, let’s say you have an online ordering website that pops up a modal asking you to confirm your order. On your laptop or computer, this looks absolutely great! It’s a useful feature to make sure I don’t have anything I didn’t order. However, this may be difficult to use on online ordering on a mobile phone as modals can sometimes be too large. Thus, there is a theme in developing and designing that should always come to mind: accessibility.
                    <br/><br/>
                        When I think of what makes a great modal, it’s always great to just be clear and straightforward. Modals should be easy to use and easy to get out of, especially because sometimes pop up content can lock users out of accessing any other content on the page. It can definitely be hit or miss, and I think it takes careful developing and testing in order to create a really good one.

                        I am an avid online shopper. On some of my off days, you can find me browsing clothing stores and shopping sites for fun, such as Amazon, Uniqlo, Etsy—you name it. Sometimes, when I encounter an online form or shopping site feature that I dislike, I’ll think of different ways of how I would fix it. This sometimes is part of my creative process of design ing forms or input fields on websites.
                    <br/><br/>
                        One of the biggest takeaways from reading the article is that it’s imperative to be clear and straightforward if you want users to have a good experience with not only forms, but with most features. Being too complex by asking hard questions off the bat, not specifying how to answer questions, and not being transparent with the user about how the information is being used are all red flags. 
                    <br/><br/>
                        Another takeaway is that developers and designers need to think about the broad range of users that will use their form — hence, we need to think accessibility. I think part of having a good experience is having an accessible website with features such as text enlarging or being able to use screen readers. A good example is <a href="https://kravebeauty.com" target="_blank">Krave Beauty</a> because they have a cool accessibility button to use different kinds of features when browsing/ordering.
