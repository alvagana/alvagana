                <h3>project</h3>
                <p>The project I’m choosing is my Game On! project to make it more user friendly.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>comparison project 1</h3>
                <p>One of the games I compare my project to is Pairs.one. One thing I really like about it is how 
                    it clearly articulates whose turn it is in a two-player mode. It’s got a simplistic design that 
                    makes it really easy to understand, and it provides accommodations for users that speak other languages. 
                    In addition, the card effects are not flashy at all; they’re simple, but effective. I think what this 
                    game and what my game can do better is to have a section that displays the rules just in case the user 
                    forgets how to play.</p>

                <h3>comparison project 2</h3>
                <p>Another game that I compare my project to is 2048. Just like the previous game, 2048 is a totally 
                    different type of game. However, one thing in particular that makes the game great is that it’s played 
                    through the keyboard. This makes the game a lot more accessible and easier to play since you don’t have 
                    to move your mouse to perform any actions. I think what can be improved is to add sound effects for when 
                    you merge your biggest tile together!</p>

                <h3>project goals</h3>
                <p>My goals for my project are to make my game easier to play. My game has a flashy interface going on and I think it’s fun/witty, but it’s difficult having to switch the mouse back and forth with another user. It’s a similar thing with the Concentration game, but that seems reasonable. What I want to implement is make it easy for users to understand how to play, and to give them flexibility in how they want to play (with or without sound, using keyboard vs. mouse, etc).</p>

                <h3>design strategies</h3>
                <p>For my design, I want to reconsider the background. The realistic background is cool, but I was thinking I could illustrate another background to use that would go with the illustrated cats I made to be more cohesive. I also want to change the introduction screen and make it more palpable to the user by placing it in the center of the screen and with more legible text to enhance readability. In addition, I’d like to change the style of the “Player #, what is your move?” text bar to be more engaging with the users by styling them similarly to my action texts.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>interaction strategies</h3>
                <p>As for interactions, I’d like to reiterate that keyboard inputs would be really neat. Allowing users to use one side of the keyboard to perform actions and to have buttons that mute the sound effects would be beneficial for all users. Perhaps even a background music as well as an added effect!</p>

            <section>
                <h3>experience goals</h3>
                <p>I want my users to experience the fun I had when playing the game myself. I hope to achieve this by making the game cleaner, smoother, and accessible.</p>
