                <h3>tasks</h3>
                <p>Hi there! Thank you so much for testing out my game!
                    Here are some simple tasks for you to do:
                    <br/>
                    - First, read about how to play the game! 
                    <br/>
                    - Put in your name + a fake name for player 2. You'll be playing as both characters.
                    <br/>
                    - Play the game with your mouse only!
                    <br/>
                    - If time permits, play again with just your keyboard.
                    <br/>
                    Thank you so much!</p>

                <h3>questions asked</h3>
                <p>1. What do you think can be improved about the interaction of the cats?<br/>

                    2. If you were to play the game with a friend, would you use the keyboard buttons or the mouse? Why?<br/>
                    
                    3. How easy is it to find everything you need? (how to play, mute button, names)<br/>
                    
                    4. In what areas is the game doing well in? What areas do you think needs more attention?<br/>
                    
                    5. Is there anything else you would like to share?<br/></p>

                <h3>user test #1</h3>
                <p>For my first user test, I learned about how I could improve the overall UX of my project. First, Adhiraj felt that it’s more intuitive to include a “How to Play” button in the loading screen to tell the users how to play. He prefers to use the mouse, but that if we were to use a keyboard to play, it might make more sense to make the “Scratch” and “Defend” keyboard buttons the same. Finally, Adhiraj suggested that I could do more interaction/styling with the loading screen and the HP bars. Overall, he thought it was pretty good and I plan to implement the “How to Play” button and more styling, so thank you Adhiraj!</p>

                <h3>user test #2</h3>
                <p>For my second user test, Raymond caught a bug that I didn’t account for which diminished his experience with playing the game. He clicked on the mute button and then pressed “Start Game”, which caused the “Scratch” and “Defend” buttons t not show. However, he was able to get around it to play the game. Overall, Raymond thought my game was great and enjoyed the visual feedback from playing the game. He suggests that the “Quit” button could be moved somewhere else, and that the bug should be fixed. I definitely will fix this bug so users don’t run into it, so thank you Raymond!</p>

                <h3>user test #3</h3>
                <p>Last but not least, Yutaka thought my game was pretty smooth and loved the text interactions when users click on the action buttons. He had a unique way of playing where one user can use the mouse and the other can use the keyboard, but also felt that both using the keyboard would also work. In terms of user experience, he suggests to make a few elements more obvious — having a “start over” button, have bigger text for names, and have bigger text for the “What is your move” text. These are all great suggestions so thank you Yutaka!</p>
